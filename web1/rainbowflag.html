    <p>The rainbow flag has become widely known as a symbol for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) community.</p>

    <p>It is typically made up of six stripes which appear in descending order from red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet, which are positioned horizontally.</p>

    <p>Originally there were eight colours in the flag, including hot pink and turquoise, with each having their own meaning.</p>

    <p>The amount was later reduced to due to limited availability of the hot pink fabric.</p>

    <p>Facebook recently paid tribute to the colourful symbol and created a rainbow flag reaction to celebrate LGBT Pride month.</p>

    <h2>What do the rainbow colours in the Pride flag mean?</h2>
    <p>Each colour in the original flag had a different meaning, which many still celebrate today.</p>
        
   
        <p>When the flag was first created, each colour in the rainbow design had a different meaning</p>

    <h2>Who created the Gay Pride flag?</h2>
    <p>Gay activist Gilbert Baker from Kansas, who was born in 1951, was the person who created the iconic flag.</p>

    <p>He taught himself to sew after getting an honourable discharge from the army in 1970.</p>

    <p>He met influential gay leader Harvey Milk in 1974, who challenged him to come up with a symbol for the gay community three years into their friendship.</p>

    <p>Rumour has it that Gilbert got his inspiration for the flag from the famous Judy Garland song Over the Rainbow.</p>

    <p>Judy was a popular gay icon, and some say Gilbert was inspired after the Stonewall riots that occurred days after her death.</p>

    <p>The riots, which saw members of the gay community stand against a police raid in Manhattan, are considered to be the most important event in the modern fight for LGBT rights in the US.</p>

    <p>Another suggestion for the origin of the flag is college campuses demonstrating for world peace in the 1960s by carrying a Flag of the Races, which held five horizontal stripes in red, white, brown, yellow and black.</p>


    <h2>When was the first Gay Pride flag used?</h2>
    <p>The original gay pride flag was seen in the San Francisco Gay Freedom Day Parade on June 25, 1978.</p>

    <p>Around 30 volunteers helped to hand-dye and stitch the first two flags for the parade.</p>
    
    <p>Demand increased after Harvey was assassinated on November 27, 1978 and the Paramount Flag Company started selling the seven striped version – red, orange, yellow, green, turquoise, blue and violet.</p>
