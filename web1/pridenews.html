        <p class="pride1">The biggest LGBT+ event to be held in Inverness in more than 15 years has been given the go-ahead by Highland Council.

    <td><h3>India court legalises gay sex in landmark ruling</h3>
        <p class="pride1">In a historic decision, India's Supreme Court has ruled that gay sex is no longer a criminal offence. He ruling overturns a 2013 judgement that upheld a colonial-era law, known as section 377, under which gay sex is categorised as an "unnatural offence". The court has now ruled discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is a fundamental violation of rights. Campaigners outside the court cheered and some broke down in tears as the ruling was handed down. Although public opinion in India's biggest cities has been in favour of scrapping the law, there remains strong opposition among religious groups and in conservative rural communities.

        <p class="pride1">Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel has backed same-sex marriage. The Cuban leader, who took over from Raúl Castro on 19 April, said he was in favour of recognising "marriage between people without any restrictions". In an interview with TV Telesur, he said doing so was "part of eliminating any type of discrimination in society". It comes as Cuba is in the process of updating its constitution, which had defined marriage as between "a man and a woman".</p></td></tr>

         <p class="pride1">People over the age of 50 account for 47 percent of Americans living with diagnosed HIV, according to the Center for Disease Control.“The HIV epidemic is dominated by older adults aging with HIV,” said Stephen Karpiak, PhD, Senior Director for Research for the ACRIA Centers at Gay Men’s Health Crisis. “These folks are experiencing significantly more illnesses associated with aging than is typical. This heavy burden of disease, including HIV, is challenging how we care for these older adults, many of whom are long-term survivors.</p></td></tr>
